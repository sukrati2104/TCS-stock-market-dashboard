# TCS-stock-market-dashboard
The TCS Stock Trend Analysis & Visualization (2018–2023) project involved a comprehensive examination of Tata Consultancy Services’ stock performance over a five-year period, with the objective of identifying patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and growth trends across multiple timeframes — daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. Historical market data, including open, close, high, and low prices for over 1,500 trading days, was sourced through the Yahoo Finance API and stored in CSV format. The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing in Excel and Python (Pandas, NumPy) to remove missing values, eliminate duplicates, and derive time-based fields such as day, month, quarter, and year. Further calculations and key performance indicators (KPIs) were created in Power BI using DAX to aggregate totals, measure year-on-year percentage changes, and ensure accuracy. The final interactive dashboard featured four primary visualizations: a day-wise line chart illustrating intra-month volatility, a month-wise chart revealing seasonal highs in January and December with lows around April, a quarter-wise trend showing mid-year dips in Q2 followed by recovery in Q3 and Q4, and a year-wise analysis highlighting steady growth until 2022 with a 2023 decline attributed to partial-year data. KPI cards summarizing cumulative open, close, high, and low values were positioned at the top for quick reference. Insights from the project included the identification of three major seasonal patterns, a 45% growth phase between 2020 and 2022 driven by post-pandemic IT demand, and a consistent alignment of open and close values over time, indicating market stability. This project not only demonstrates proficiency in data acquisition, cleaning, and visualization but also reflects the ability to contextualize financial data for strategic investment decision-making.
